## Summary of Rawlsian Argument for Veganism
### Veil of Ignorance
- Imagine you are behind a veil of ignorance, you don't know your **race**, **gender**, **class**, **talents**, or **species**
- From this position, you chooser the **principles of justice** that we should govern society - ensuring fairness regardless of your eventual place in it
- Rational agents behind the veil would not set up a system of animal exploitation, and should instead minimize suffering for all sentient beings under risk of being one.
