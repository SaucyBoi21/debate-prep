## Where does moral worth comes from

- **Capacity** for human consciousness
	- Counter to name the trait
- Sentience alone is not enough to define moral worth

## Unnecessary suffering
- Force them to define unnecessary
	- There is no reason to do so - **this is wrong**
	- You can survive without it - **this leads to reduction**
- Suffering of animals (and even in many cases of humans) is permissible, as long as there is some reason for doing so

## Factory Farming
- Factory farming is a moral abomination and must be abolished - don't let them straw man the position and just concede this

## Animals' Right to Life
- **Syllogism**
	- Sentient beings have the right to life
	- Animals have sentience
	- Animals have the right to life
- **Key Counters**
	- Rights and responsibility modus tollens
	- Any level of sentience matters leads to reduction
	- Force them to define their definition of rights (are they inalienable or not?)
