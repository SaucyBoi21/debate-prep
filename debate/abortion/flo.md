## General Summary
- Future Like Ours (FLO) was an argument developed by philosopher Don Marquis in his 1989 paper "Why Abortion is Immoral"
- He argued that the reason why abortion is wrong is due to depriving an individual of their valuable future, a **future like ours**
- Life contains experiences, relationships, goals, joys, and growth, all of which we know are valuable
- Killing isn't wrong because of **pain or consciousness** , but rather because it robs someone of a valuable future
## Formal Syllogism
- Killing is wrong because it deprives an individual of a valuable future
- A fetus has a future like ours - full of experiences, relationships, and pleasure
- Abortion deprives the fetus of that future
- Therefore, abortion is morally wrong
## Major Strengths of FLO
- Secular - it doesn't rely on religion at all
- It avoids debates about consciousness
- It explains why killing is wrong in general

## Arguments against FLO
- Contraception argument
- "Possible Worlds" argument
- "Lucky murderer" argument
	- Let's say that I choose to murder someone and the autopsy showcases that he would have died in an hour due to brain hemorrhages. According to FLO, this isn't immoral
- "Firing Squad"
	- If 4 people fire at a man, but even if they didn't the person wouldn't have a FLO, so not one of them did something immoral
