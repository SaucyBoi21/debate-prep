# Reductio Ad Absurdum

## Reduction 1: Moral Obligation to 64-celled life forms

- Unicellular organisms have moral worth
- Would it be wrong to murder a zygote that can't develop further?

- If yes, we have a moral obligation to deliver this zygote
- We must keep this alive for as long as possible

- If no, why does a human being lose moral worth?
- Loss of capacity for human conciousness proves the pro-choice position that it's not inherently being human that gives us value, it's the concious experience

## Reduction 2: Appropriate Punishments for death of zygotes

- If a woman miscarries, has she committed manslaughter?
- Should we investigate miscarriages the same way we investigate infanticide?

- IVFs become a moral abomination

## Reduction 3: Edge-case scenarios

- If abortion is ok for cases of rape and incest, why is it ok to murder these zygotes?
- If it is for the good of the child, then infanticide is ok

- Either it is never ok for abortion, or a zygote doesn't have the same moral consideration as a child
